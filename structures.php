    <p>Structural design patterns focus on managing inheretence within object oriented languages (<a href="https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns">source</a>). With these patterns, objects are assigned similar or seperate functionality while typically maintaining the same function names.</p>
    <p>Some patterns meant to keep objects working in a similar way, despite having different internal structures. Adapters and facades, for example, focus on redefinng functions to allow different objects to have the same functionality.</p>
    <p>There are also design patterns meant to do the opposite - allow an object to be interacted with using methods it was not orriginally designed for. Bridges are a strong example of this, since the data and the interactions are kept seperate.</p>
