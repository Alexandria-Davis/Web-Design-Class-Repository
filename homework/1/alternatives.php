    <p>Not all programmers find the responce to design patterns to be appropriate. A "Keep it simple stupid" strategy is prefered by some, potentially including one Lawrence krubner (<a href="http://www.smashcompany.com/technology/the-angry-argument-against-design-patterns">source - note that the passage may be his attempt to quote another's thoughts</a>). He finds that the patterns tend to be overused, and often pulled before the problem is accurately identified.</p>
    <p>Some patterns, such as signleton are also at risk for deterioration when used nievely, such as when singleton is used across multiple threads (<a href="https://blogitwithsatyam.com/2018/06/04/design-patterns-arguments-for-and-against/">source</a>), or can cause other problems.</p>
